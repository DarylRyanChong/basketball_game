# 🏀 Basketball Shooting Game

A physics-based basketball shooting game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. 

*The code was made with the help of Google Antigravity (Google DeepMind's new IDE).*

## 🎯 How This Project Came to Be

This project started as an experiment in **modeling basic physics** — specifically kinematics and dynamics. I was trying to model:

- **Gravity and velocity**
- **Collision detection** and bounce physics
- **Friction** on surfaces
- **Euler integration** for simulating motion

After getting a bouncing ball working with realistic physics, I thought: *"Why not make this into a game?"*


## 🎮 How to Play

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ← → Arrow Keys | Aim your shot |
| SPACE (hold) | Charge power |
| SPACE (release) | Shoot! |
| SPACE (after shot) | Reset ball |

## ✨ Features

- **Realistic physics** — gravity, bounce, friction
- **Adjustable parameters** — sliders for gravity, bounciness, friction, time scale
- **Score tracking** — hoop moves to a new position after each basket
- **Easter egg** — try scoring from below the hoop 🤡
